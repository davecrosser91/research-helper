# Search Execution Agent Implementation

## Epic-1/Story-3: Research Workflow Agents

### Changes Made
- Implemented SearchExecutionAgent for systematic paper retrieval
- Added batched processing with configurable batch sizes
- Implemented retry logic and error handling for API calls
- Created test script demonstrating functionality
- Added comprehensive paper metadata handling

### Technical Details
- Uses `tenacity` for robust retry logic
- Implements batching to handle large result sets efficiently
- Full metadata capture including:
  - Paper details (title, authors, abstract)
  - Categories and dates
  - URLs and identifiers
  - Journal references and DOIs

### Testing
- Added test script `test_search_execution.py`
- Tested with:
  - Different batch sizes
  - Category filtering
  - Date range filtering
  - Error handling scenarios

### Dependencies
- Added `tenacity` for retry logic
- Uses existing `arxiv` package

### Related Issues
